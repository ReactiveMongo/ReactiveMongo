/**
 * Macros for generating `BSONReader` and `BSONWriter` implementations for case
 * at compile time. Invoking these macros is equivalent to writing anonymous
 * class implementations by hand.
 *
 * Example
 * {{{
 * case class Person(name: String, surname: String)
 * implicit val personHandler = Macros.handler[Person]
 * }}}
 *
 * Use `reader` to generate the `BSONReader` and `writer` for `BSONWriter` or
 * `handler` for a class that extends both. Respective methods with 'Opts'
 * appended take additional options in form of type parameters.
 *
 * The `A` type parameter defines case class that will be the basis for
 * auto-generated implementation. Some other types with matching apply-unapply
 * might work but behaviour is undefined. Since macros will match the
 * apply-unapply pair you are free to overload these methods in the companion
 * object.
 *
 * Fields in the case class get mapped into BSON properties with respective
 * names and BSON handlers are pulled from implicit scope to (de)serialize
 * them. In order to use custom types inside case classes just make sure
 * appropriate handlers are in scope. Note that companion objects are searched
 * too. For example if you have `case class Foo(bar: Bar)` and want to create a
 * handler for it is enough to put an implicit handler for `Bar` in it's
 * companion object. That handler might be macro generated or written by hand.
 *
 * Case classes can also be defined inside other classes, objects or traits
 * but not inside functions(known limitation). In order to work you should
 * have the case class in scope(where you call the macro) so you can refer to
 * it by it's short name - without package. This is necessary because the
 * generated implementations refer to it by the short name to support
 * nested declarations. You can work around this with local imports.
 *
 * Example
 * {{{
 * implicit val handler = {
 *   import some.package.Foo
 *   Macros.handler[Foo]
 * }
 * }}}
 *
 * Option types are handled somewhat specially: a field of type Option[T]
 * will only be appended to the document if it contains a value. Similarly
 * if a document does not contain a value it will be read as None.
 *
 * Also supported neat trick are 'union types' that make for easy work with
 * algebraic data types. See the UnionType option for more details.
 *
 * You can also create recursive structures by explicitly annotating types of
 * the implicit handlers. (To let the compiler know they exist)
 * Example
 * {{{
 * sealed trait Tree
 * case class Node(left: Tree, right: Tree) extends Tree
 * case class Leaf(data: String) extends Tree
 *
 * object Tree {
 *   import Macros.Options._
 *   implicit val bson: Handler[Tree] = Macros.handlerOpts[Tree, UnionType[Node \/ Leaf]]
 * }
 * }}}
 *
 * @see Macros.Options for specific options
