# ReactiveMongo

ReactiveMongo is a scala driver that provides fully non-blocking and asynchronous I/O operations.

## Usage

First add the dependencies in your `build.sbt`.

```scala
libraryDependencies ++= Seq(
  "org.reactivemongo" %% "reactivemongo" % "VERSION"
)
```

[![Maven](https://img.shields.io/maven-central/v/org.reactivemongo/reactivemongo_2.12.svg)](http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Ca%3A%22reactivemongo_2.12%22) [![Javadocs](https://javadoc.io/badge/org.reactivemongo/reactivemongo_2.12.svg)](https://javadoc.io/doc/org.reactivemongo/reactivemongo_2.12)

*See the [documentation](http://reactivemongo.org)*

## Build manually

To benefit from the latest improvements and fixes, you may want to compile ReactiveMongo from source. You will need a [Git client](http://git-scm.com/) and [SBT](http://www.scala-sbt.org).

From the shell, first checkout the source:

```
$ git clone git@github.com:ReactiveMongo/ReactiveMongo.git
```

Then go to the `ReactiveMongo` directory and launch the SBT build console:

```
$ cd ReactiveMongo
$ sbt
> +publish-local
```

*Running tests:*

In order to execute the unit and integration tests, SBT can be used as follows.

    sbt "testOnly -- exclude mongo2"

When running against MongoDB 2.6, the command must replace `exclude mongo2` with `exclude not_mongo26`.

> The test environement must be able to handle the maximum number of incoming connection for the MongoDB instance. This must be checked, and eventually updated, using `ulimit -n`.
